# pingpong
Mike Hoeft and Daniel Minor's First Epicodus Program
This is a program whereby a user types in a positive integer.
The program starts at "1" and increments up +1 up to the inputted integer (as an array).
If the number is divisible by 3, the output is "ping."
If the number is divisible by 5, the output is "pong."
If the number is divisible by 15, the output is "ping-pong."  
If the number is divisible by neither 3 nor 5, the output is the number itself.

An example is: input of the number 7.
The output will be: [1,2,"ping",4,"pong","ping",7]
